Lock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no fools for the world to see
Trade my whole life just to be
Tell nobody I control you
I broke you just to own you
They can't tell that I love you
'Cause you're loyal, baby
I love when you're submissive
Love it when I break skin
You feel pain without flinchin'
So say it
Give me tough love
Leave me with nothin' when I come down
My kinda loveLock me up and throw away the key
He knows how to get the best out of me
I'm no fools for the world to see
I don't gotta be the one, no
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight (tonight)
We don't gotta be in love, no
I don't gotta be the one, no (oh)
I just wanna be one of your girls tonight, oh (oh)
